<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


This repository contains the code and data files for a Machine Learning project aimed at  developing a machine learning model capable of predicting the likelihood of customer churn within Vodafone's customer base and to identify key indicators of customer churn and devise effective retention strategies to reduce the rate of customers leaving. 

Features
The key attributes in the dataset include:

1. **Customer ID**: A unique identifier assigned to each customer. 

2. **Senior Citizen**: A binary attribute indicating whether the customer is a senior citizen (usually defined as aged 65 and older).

3. **Partner**: A binary attribute indicating whether the customer has a partner (e.g., spouse, significant other).

4. **Dependants**: A binary attribute indicating whether the customer has dependents (e.g., children, elderly relatives) who rely on them financially.

5. **Tenure**: The length of time (usually in months) that the customer has been subscribed to the service.

6. **Phone Service**: A binary attribute indicating whether the customer subscribes to phone service.

7. **Multiple Lines**: A categorical attribute indicating whether the customer has multiple phone lines.

8. **Internet Service**: The type of internet service subscribed to by the customer (e.g., DSL, fiber optic).

9. **Contract**: The type of contract the customer has (e.g., month-to-month, one year, two years).

10. **Payment Method**: The method of payment used by the customer (e.g., electronic check, credit card, bank transfer).

11. **Monthly Charges**: The amount charged to the customer on a monthly basis.

12. **Total Charges**: The total amount charged to the customer over the entire tenure.

13. **Churn**: A binary attribute indicating whether the customer has churned (i.e., canceled their subscription) or not.
